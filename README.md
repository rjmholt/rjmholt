### Hi, I'm Rob

I work for Microsoft on PowerShell and related bits and pieces.

I'm a project maintainer of and contributor to:
  - [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
  - [The PowerShell extension for VSCode](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-PowerShell)
    and its backend [PowerShell Editor Services](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices)
  - [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer), the static analyzer/linter for PowerShell
  
My current areas of expertise include:

- The PowerShell language (i.e. the structure of PowerShell's syntax and its semantics),
  as well as a working knowledge of the PowerShell parser, AST and compiler implementations
- The PowerShell module system
- The PowerShell extension for VSCode and its innards
- PSScriptAnalyzer, how it works, and what can and can't be statically analysed in PowerShell
- Getting PowerShell to play nicely with threads
- Using reflection and assembly loading mechanisms to make PowerShell do your bidding

If you're looking to get in contact with me:

- Open an issue on the project you need help with
- Find me on Twitter: [@rjmholt](https://twitter.com/rjmholt)
- Send an email to my GitHub email account (I don't check this quite as often)

Also, I know my bio says "FP enthusiast", but it's been a while since I wrote much in that space.
Let me know if you've got a project in Rust, OCaml, Haskell or Erlang and want a part-time contributor!
